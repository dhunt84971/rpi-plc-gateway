Raspberry Pi - Wireless to Wired PLC Targeted Router Manager

## Description
This project is intended to contain everything that is required to build a 3.5" Touchscreen Raspberry Pi that can be used to route network traffic from a wireless network to an island LAN network on the industrial machine.  Specifically the application in this repo is targeting an EthernetIP PLC at port 44818 so that a remote PC running a development environment using RSLinx can make a direct connection to the PLC.

## Technology
A Raspberry Pi with a 3.5" touchscreen was selected to host the application because of its small size and low price.  The standard Raspbian Desktop OS was selected as the operating system because of its wide support and well documented instructions.  Nodejs and Electron will be used as the platform for the router manager application.  Electron makes it easy to create a small user friendly interface and also provides the opportunity to create a webbased version in the future.  Nodejs is well supported on the Raspberry Pi.
