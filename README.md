Raspberry Pi - Wireless to Wired PLC Targeted Router Manager

## Description
This project is intended to contain everything that is required to build a 3.5" Touchscreen Raspberry Pi that can be used to route network traffic from a wireless network to an island LAN network on the industrial machine.  Specifically the application in this repo is targeting an EthernetIP PLC at port 44818 so that a remote PC running a development environment using RSLinx can make a direct connection to the PLC.
